      <h2>Paul Flanagan</h2>
      <p>I'm working towards being a <a href='http://freecodecamp.com/' target='_blank'>coder</a>.</p>
	 <p>I'm a TV/Computer technician. I've been using HTML and CSS for since around 2000 when I designed a website to showcase an exhibition 
	 of horror video covers and posters that I had organised in our library. I took night classes in Visual Basic, Dreamweaver and Flash, 
	 before I discovered online courses.  These courses helped me to maintain a website at my workplace, and also a couple of sites that 
	 I designed for local roofing businesses. As I needed a particular function on a site â€“ I would learn just enough of a language to 
	 carry out the task e.g. searching a database or sending an email. More recently, I have been trying to expand my knowledge of coding 
	 with Python, JavaScript and PHP at Code Academy, Coursera and Free Code Camp.</p>
	 <p>I was feeling overwhelmed by a multitude of online tutorials and eBooks, and was beginning to despair as I wasn't sure how to 
		progress - or even if I was learning the right things. Free Code Camp looked like it could provide much-needed focus, and after 
		reading an article there - I realised that I was at a stage in my coding education where I need to take a leap into the unknown. 
		Hopefully the Ziplines section of the course will provide the shove. To get some added experience, I am also helping a friend 
		redesign his film review website and teaching him some of what I have learned.

            A work in progress. Originally intended to share my collection of horror video posters and video covers from the 1980s, the site also became a home for a bibliography and occasional reviews.  It needs to be made responsive, and I need to rewrite an old ASP script in PHP, to query a magazine database.

          <p>
            For my work's website I used a template and altered it to suit our requirements. I also added a customer query form linked to a PHP script on our ISP's server. The form takes details from the customer and the PHP script sends me an email.
